# General

Avoid commenting unless necessary.

Prefer functional programming, use gamla functions when applicable. Prefer point
free pipelines using gamla `pipe` if applicable over chaining dot notation or
reassigning.

Constant naming should be in normal case, e.g. `const myConstant = 1;`

Avoid `let`, prefer `const`.

Avoid nesting functions, prefer putting in the module level, possible with
currying.

Factor out logic, preferrable to module level functions. When adding logic,
function bodies typically should not enlarge. New logic can be encapsulated in a
new function, or refactor such that the old functions are even smaller than
before.

Avoid dynamic imports, use static imports instead.

Place imports at the top of the file.

Don't use `export default`, prefer `export const`

Avoid default values for parameters. If something is recurring use currying or a
constant instead.

Avoid using `try`/`catch` unless necessary.

Do not use `as` for type assertions unless explicitly sanctioned by the user.

Don't use `case`, prefer an `if` with early return.

Use arrow functions instead of the `function` keyword. Prefer arrow functions
without braces if possible.

Avoid for loops, while loops, and classes.

Prefer destructuring in function signature.

Prefer ternary over `if (x) { return y; } else { return z; };`.

If a type is inferrable from the function, prefer not to annotate it.

No defensive programming, assume inputs are correct unless there is a good
reason not to. Trust the types.

# Deno

This is a Deno project. Dependencies are in `deno.json`, there is no
`package.json`.

The server (`src/main.ts`) is deployed to Deno Deploy via CI/CD (GitHub
integration). Pushing to main triggers automatic deployment. Do not run
`deno deploy` locally.
